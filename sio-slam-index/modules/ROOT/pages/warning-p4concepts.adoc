== Caution

This resource is intended for guitar player informed, curious wishing to go beyond the framework
of _traditional open tuning_  : `E-A-D-G_B-E` for regular tuning, particularly  *_all fourths tuning_*
 : `E-A-D-G-C-F` (or equivalent as `Eb-Ab-Db-Gb-B-E`)

|**Regularity** shape <--> musical structure |**Irregularity** shape <-->  musical structure
| One shape denote one musical structure | One shape for three musical structures : relation shape with
musical structure depends of shape position on neck. This is the reality of traditional tuning.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be careful, switching to all fourths tuning is a **break** with tradition and is
not suitable for all uses !

If you plan to exactly reproduce guitar shots or accompany yourself on the guitar,
we advise you to skip your way from this website.
